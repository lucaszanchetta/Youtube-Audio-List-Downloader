# Youtube-Audio-List-Downloader
This script can be used to download audio from videos in mass. 
It can be useful if you are have a podcast on YouTube and want to upload your podcast in audio form to somewhere like SoundCloud for your viewers to listen to.
Piracy is illegal, please do not use this script to download movies or music you are not supposed to.

This script needs Python 3 installed with the youtube-dl library installed
To download youtube-dl you can use Python's PIP
The script also needs FFMPEG installed, I believe most Linux distros come with this but you will likely need to install it on Windows and MacOS

To use the script, you make a text file in the directory of the script and on each line, you put the search qurey for the video you want to download and then run the script. The script will ask for the name of the text file while showing the contents of the directory and you then input the text files name and the script should then begin downloading the content in the text file.
